# Auros-s-Auto-Pause
A Beat Saber mod which will pause the game if your FPS drops below 40 or if it detects tracking issues.


In modprefs.ini, you can edit five values: The FPS threshold (the FPS value you need to reach in order for the game to pause), if the plugin is enabled or disabled, if you want to enable or disable the FPS checker system, whether or not you want voices or not, and how often the system checks for tracking issues (leave at default unless you know what you're doing, ask me on discord if confused)
