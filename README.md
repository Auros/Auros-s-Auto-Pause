# Auros-s-Auto-Pause
A Beat Saber mod which will pause the game if your FPS drops below 40 or if it detects tracking issues.


I don't really wanna do this description properly.
In modprefs.ini, you can edit two values: The FPS threshold (the FPS value you need to reach in order for the game to pause) and a true or false value to enable or disable the FPS checker system (because some people requested)
